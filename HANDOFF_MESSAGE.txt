I'm continuing work on the Data-Agent app. Full handoff is in Data-Agent/HANDOFF.md — read that file first.

**Summary:** Data-Agent is an AI-assisted MRRpV app. Three data sources (first_purchase, upsell, fleet); toggle order First purchases, Upsell, Fleet overall; default First purchases. First-purchase MRRpV not divided by 12. getMRRpV: time_window optional (omit = all data), group_by optional (omit = overall), include_product (deals with product license count > 0), includeAccountCount/includeAvgDealSize for account_count and avg_deal_size; result includes overall summary. Agent: MRRPV_RULES prepended (never ask for grouping; always state overall). Schema mapping: docs/mrrpv-schema-mapping.md; glossary: backend/src/queries/column-glossary.js. Run: npm run dev from Data-Agent root; .env in root; SSL: NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 for local. See HANDOFF.md for paths and open items.
